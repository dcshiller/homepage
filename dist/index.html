There are two key moves. One is to embrace functionalism about attitudes. The second is to adopt expressivism about the norms that govern them and use that expressivism to justify treating the norms as primitive.   This paper explores the relation between the negation problem and the significance of parsimony in metaethical theory choice.</p></div></article><h2>In Defense of Artificial Replacement</h2><article class="project"><div><span class="journal">Bioethics 2017</span><p>If it is within our power to provide a significantly better world for future generations at a comparatively small cost to ourselves, we have a strong moral reason to do so. One way of providing a significantly better world may involve replacing our species with something better. It is plausible that in the not-too-distant future, we will be able to create artificially intelligent creatures with whatever physical and psychological traits we choose. Granted this assumption, it is argued that we should engineer our extinction so that our planet's resources can be devoted to making artificial creatures with better lives.</p></div></article><h2>Hidden Qualia<a class="icon fa fa-file draft" href="/drafts/DerekShiller.HiddenQualia.pdf"></a></h2><article class="project"><div><span class="journal">Review of Philosophy and Psychology 2017</span><p>We generally take it for granted that we know what what it feels like to be us. Some conscious experiences may escape our attention, but by and large we are capable of knowing just about anything about our conscious experiences. I offer several arguments against this assumption.</p></div></article><h2>The Problem of Other Attitudes </h2><article class="project"><div><span class="journal">American Philosophical Quarterly 2017</span><p>I argue that noncognitivists face a problem in explaining moral attitudes other than judgment that is somewhat analogous to the Frege/Geach problem.  Noncognitivists have focused on providing analyzes of what it takes to think that an action is wrong. They have been silent on what it takes to hope that an action is wrong, or to intend to do the right thing (whatever that turns out to be). I consider extending several noncognitivist proposals into systematic accounts of the nature of moral attitudes, and argue that none is plausible.</p></div></article><span> <h2>The Unity of Moral Attitudes:</h2><h3>Recipe Semantics and Credal Exaptation</h3></span><article class="project"><div><!-- a.icon.fa.fa-file.draft(href="/drafts/DerekShiller.RecipeSemanticsForNoncognitivism.pdf")--><span class="journal">Canadian Journal of Philosophy Forthcoming</span><p>This paper offers a noncognitivist characterization of moral attitudes, according to which moral attitudes count as such because of their inclusion of moral concepts. Moral concepts are distinguished by their contribution to the functional roles of some  of the attitudes in which they can occur. They have no particular functional role in other attitudes, and should instead be viewed as evolutionary spandrels. In order to make the counter-intuitive implications of the view more palatable, the paper ends with an account of the evolution of normative judgments as exaptations of the cognitive structures that underlie beliefs. </p></div></article><h1>In Progress</h1><h2>Sleeping Beauty and the Limits of Conditionalization<a class="icon fa fa-file draft" href="/drafts/DerekShiller.SleepingBeautyAndTheLimitsOfConditionalization.pdf"></a></h2><article class="project"><div><span class="journal">Work in Progress</span><p>Thirders have traditionally relied on conditionalizations in arguing for their favored answer to the Sleeping Beauty problem. This paper offers a critique of such applications of conditionalization. It is argued that while conditionalization may be generally appropriate, it's appropriateness is dependent on whether certain evidential features are preserved over time. In the Sleeping Beauty scenario, it appears as if the relevant features are not preserved. Therefore, the major arguments for thirdism should be unconvincing. </p></div></article></div><div class="webdev hidden"><h2>Neural Network Project</h2><article class="project"><img src="./images/screenshots/nnp.png" alt=""><ul><p>A javascript neural network builder</p><p>(designed for google's chrome browser)</p><span class="linkRow"><a href="http://www.derekshiller.com/nnp/nnp.html">Live</a><a href="http://github.com/dcshiller/nnp">Github</a></span></ul></article><h2>Where Do They Publish?</h2><article class="project"><img src="./images/screenshots/WDTP.png" alt=""><ul><p>A web interface for querying publication metadata</p><li>Live version written in Go</li><span class="linkRow"><a href="http://wheredotheypublish.derekshiller.com">Live</a></span></ul></article><h2>Philosophy Data Project</h2><article class="project"><img src="./images/screenshots/pdp.png" alt=""><ul><p>Web database for philosophy data</p><li>Written in Rails</li><span class="linkRow"><a href="http://polar-eyrie-33608.herokuapp.com">Live</a></span></ul></article><h2>Piper</h2><article class="project"><img src="./images/screenshots/Piper.png" alt=""><ul><p>Puzzle game inspired by Microsoft's Pipe Dream written with jQuery</p><li>Uses jQuery to manipulate HTML canvases</li><li>Computes vector information of components under variable rotations</li><li>Saves high scores with AJAX and PHP </li><span class="linkRow"><a href="http://www.derekshiller.com/piper/piper.php">Live</a><a href="http://github.com/dcshiller/piper">Github</a></span></ul></article><h2>Turing Machine Simulator</h2><article class="project"><img src="./images/screenshots/TuringMachineSimulator.png" alt=""><ul><p>A terminal program for creating and running Turing machine programs.</p><li>Uses and reuses custom pannelling module to produce complex terminal displays with DRY code</li><li>Supports creation, editing, and saving programs as YAML objects </li><span class="linkRow"><a href="http://github.com/dcshiller/turing">Github</a></span></ul></article></div><div class="other hidden"><ul><li> <a href="/appacademy.html">Review of App Academy</a></li></ul></div></main></body></html>
