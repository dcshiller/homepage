      <h2>
        Thoughts on App Academy
      </h2>

<p>
  In the Spring of 2016, I decided to leave academia (my background is in academic philosophy) for greener pastures. As I was preparing to leave, I looked at a number of different possible careers. The one that was most personally appealing and easiest to transition into was web development. I had heard about coding bootcamps and quickly found App Academy (a/A). The payment model (charges based on first years salary) was appealing, not so much for financial reasons, but for what it conveyed about the program. While their interests were not totally aligned with mine, they did have a vested interest in getting me a job.
</p>

<p>
  Now that I have been out of their program for about six months, I have no regrets.
</p>

<h3>
  My Background
</h3>

<p>
  I don't have a background in computer science, but I have played around with code here and there since high school. I took an intro to programming class in college and did well, and developed a small personal project ( a vocabulary flash card program) in java that I continued to tinker with for a semester or so. I went on to get a PhD in philosophy that provided me with a basic grounding in formal logic and computability theory. I think my philosophical education helped a lot. I applied for the program at a/A being able to code very basic programs, but not knowing anything about ruby or javascript.
</p>

<h3>
  The Curriculum
</h3>

<p>
  The curriculum at a/A was divided into two parts. First, there is a stretch of seven weeks in which the aim was to provide students with  a taste of a few languages and frameworks. Instruction included four components: assigned readings, lectures, pair programing, and tests. The assigned readings gave an overview of languages and concepts which were to be covered in the next day's lectures. Those concepts were then put to use in pair programming. Every week, there would be a timed test that involved writing code and running unit tests against it.
</p>

<p>
  I generally didn't study the readings very closely, but I did skim through them each night. I also didn't feel like I got a lot out of the lectures. The materials were not bad, but I learned a lot better from actually putting the concepts into practice, and so I didn't think my time was well-spent trying to carefully prepare. There was a lot of material that you need to learn, and so rather than try to master it all, I focused on figuring out what I needed to know when I needed to know it.
</p>

<p>
  The tests each covered one segment of the course and were weekly. Some of the tests involved designing a series of short functions (write a method that finds the nth prime number), and some involved writing a whole simple program. The tests were timed and graded with the help of a suite of unit tests. Passing required getting a certain percentage of the tests to pass. Generally, there were something on the order 35 code tests, and passing required getting roughly 30 of them to pass. Failing two tests nominally meant being kicked out of the program, but the authorities did not announce the passing cut-offs beforehand. From what we could tell, the bar was tailored after the fact to produce the results that they wanted.
</p>

<p>
  Out of our cohort of roughly 35-40 people, six were asked to leave the program after having failed two tests. People failed for different reasons. Some were just not sufficiently engaged in the material to learn it sufficiently. Some had trouble handling the format and stress involved in timed tests. Some people got unlucky and hit bugs that were not easily fixable. Some couldn't keep up with the pace.
</p>

<p>
  In general, I think almost everyone who was admitted had the capacity to pass the tests if they devoted enough time to it. The tests were rather challenging, but we were given practice tests that mirrored the format of the actual tests extremely closely. Especially in the later parts of the curriculum, passing the tests involved mostly just repeating the practice tests until you knew all of the particular tricks and difficulties involved in those specific problems, and praying you didn't hit a bug you couldn't work out in the time allotted. They were sufficiently finicky that I suspect I would have trouble passing some of them even now without first looking over the practice tests carefully to understand how they wanted it done. There is something unappealing about this kind of test because it focuses more on memorization than understanding. However, I think it was valuable in forcing us to memorize certain things that would be useful for building understanding later on. 
</p>

<p>
  In pair programming, we were assigned another student to work with and given projects to do. These projects ranged from practicing concepts like recursion to implementing data structures like associative arrays, to writing small programs like minesweeper. We were generally given a lot of guidance in what the resulting program should look like, and often were provided with tests to verify that we were proceeding on track. This felt too formulaic sometimes, but Iâ€™m not sure that there was a better way to keep everyone on track. It was rare to get through all of the assignments in the day, and so many projects were left partially unfinished.
</p>

<p>
  They incorporated a couple of larger projects into the curriculum, which were to be done individually, but which were otherwise like the normal pairing projects. These included making light versions of ActiveRecord and Rails. These projects could be polished up later and included as part of your portfolio when applying for jobs.
</p>

<p>
  Pair programming was valuable in learning different ways to approach a problem. I learned a lot of new syntax, methods, and approaches from my peers. It was also just an enjoyable way to spend the day. Working with someone also gave us practice explaining our thought processes to another person, and generally made for better code. It could, however, also be tiring to code with someone who did not want to be there. Overall, I think that pair programming was the most valuable part of the curriculum.
</p>

<h3>
  TAs
</h3>
<p>
  Teaching Assistants were available to answer questions and help solve resistant bugs. The teaching assistants, who also gave the lectures, were former students of the course. Almost all of them had themselves graduated in the few months before I started. Several members of my cohort were hired as teaching assistants as well.
</p>
  
<p>
  On the one hand, this meant that almost no one on the teaching staff had had a normal job as a software engineer. They instructed us on a lot of norms of the industry and writing code, but they did not actually have experience first-hand. On the other hand, they were very knowledgeable about the curriculum, and knew more than enough to provide helpful guidance. Experienced devs are not cheap, and looking back, I would not want to have paid a higher tuition in exchange for people with industry experience.
</p>

<p>
  Overall, I was very impressed by the quality of teaching provided. Higher education in general is really hit or miss. Some professors try to do a good job, but there are few incentives for excellence in teaching. I often got the advice when I was a graduate student to put as little effort into teaching as I could get away with. At prestigious universities, research matters much much more for career success than teaching. As a result, I don't think that higher education provides the best educational experience. a/A felt very different. They had a clear stake in the success of their students, and hence put some thought into how they could best teach the material. They continued to experiment with better ways with each cohort. Sometimes the course materials were rough or ineffective, but I think that should be fully expected for a school that moves so quickly. I continue to be astounded by how far a/A has come in such a short time.
</p>
 
<h3>
  Capstone Project
</h3>

<p>
  After the main curriculum portion, students are given two weeks to build a capstone project. There is less guidance on this part. We were given a list of website to choose as models to clone, and told to use React and Rails to clone them, but were not given much in the way of further instructions. Unlike the pairing portion, design choices were ours to make. At the start, we had to create a plan for what the site would look like and a schedule of when we would complete the features. The TAs would check that we were keeping to the schedule. But otherwise, we were on our own.
</p>

<p>
  This was the only time that I really worked as hard as they advertised. I was into the classroom by 7 AM each day and left around 9 PM each night. Having to actually make something without guidance really forces you to learn the technology for yourself. I went into the project having a fuzzy understanding of the value of React and Rails, and came out with a less fuzzy sense of things.
</p>

<p>
  Some students projects were cleaner than others. (my capstone project is at <a href="http://formu.derekshiller.com">formu.derekshiller.com</a>). At this point, the product is largely a matter of how much effort one is willing to put in. I think that the people who really enjoyed coding did a good job of putting together a nice capstone project, though a lot of people took more than the two weeks we were given for it to have a usable site. The fact that we were required to make a clone of an existing site may have also dampened the quality. While we talked about continuing to tinker with the projects after the capstone period, Most people were ready to move on and do something else ASAP. If you look through existing projects, you'll find a number that are only partially completed.
</p>

<p>
  After the capstone project, we were also given time to make a project of our own using JavaScript. This did not have to be a clone of anything, and did not have to meet any particular criteria. A lot of people chose to do games. In general, students seemed to enjoy this a lot more than the capstone. These tended to reflect a lot more love, and some people came up with some really cool things. (see mine at <a href="http://www.derekshiller.com/piper/piper.php"> /piper/piper.php</a>)
</p>

<h3>
  Job Search
</h3>

<p>
  The last two weeks of the curriculum were devoted to finding a job. The teaching staff is much reduced (they started teaching the next cohort), and the handful TAs that remain go through resumes, cover letters, and look over capstone projects to make sure that everything was in order. They required us to spend a lot of time getting everything in order and would make requests about fairly small bugs with our projects, or the wording of our resumes.
</p>

<p>
  During this period, we also spent a fair bit of time practicing for interviews. We paired off and gave each other standard problems to solve in five or ten minutes on a white board. These questions closely resembled the ones that I actually got at interviews, both in their content and in their level of difficulty. 
</p>

<p>
  In the final week, they make you apply to ten jobs a day. The idea is that anyone can find a job with enough applications. Some people took this more seriously than others, and while they set up a complex system of tracking applications and issuing punishments, they were generally fairly lenient, from what I could tell, with people who put in a good faith effort.
</p>

<p>
  They advertise very rosy statistics â€” 98% job placement with an average salary ~90k. I was always skeptical of these numbers, and suspect that they are not entirely honest, but I donâ€™t think they were grossly inaccurate either. Few people in my cohort found jobs within the first month, but I am under the impression that most people who were serious found jobs eventually, and many of the jobs were the kinds of jobs that they advertised for. 
</p>

<p>
  I ended up accepting a position at a startup using Rails (<a href="http://www.dailypay.com">Dailypay</a>), and I felt totally satisfied that I received exactly what a/A advertised.
