        span.journal Ethical Theory and Moral Practice 2016
        | In this paper, I present the case against Unwin and Schroeder's negation problem. There are two key moves. One is to embrace functionalism about attitudes. The second is to adopt expressivism about the norms that govern them and use that expressivism to justify treating the norms as primitive.   This paper explores the relation between the negation problem and the significance of parsimony in metaethical theory choice.

      h2 In Defense of Artificial Replacement

        span.journal Bioethics 2017
        p If it is within our power to provide a significantly better world for future generations at a comparatively small cost to ourselves, we have a strong moral reason to do so. One way of providing a significantly better world may involve replacing our species with something better. It is plausible that in the not-too-distant future, we will be able to create artificially intelligent creatures with whatever physical and psychological traits we choose. Granted this assumption, it is argued that we should engineer our extinction so that our planet's resources can be devoted to making artificial creatures with better lives.

        p We generally take it for granted that we know what what it feels like to be us. Some conscious experiences may escape our attention, but by and large we are capable of knowing just about anything about our conscious experiences. I offer several arguments against this assumption.

        span.journal Forthcoming in American Philosophical Quarterly
        p I argue that noncognitivists face a problem in explaining moral attitudes other than judgment that is somewhat analogous to the Frege/Geach problem.  Noncognitivists have focused on providing analyzes of what it takes to think that an action is wrong. They have been silent on what it takes to hope that an action is wrong, or to intend to do the right thing (whatever that turns out to be). I consider extending several noncognitivist proposals into systematic accounts of the nature of moral attitudes, and argue that none is plausible.

            span.journal Work in Progress
            p Noncognitivists must account for the menagerie of moral attitudes of which we are psychologically capable. This paper offers a systematic explanation of these attitudes by means of a recipe semantics. Unlike extant noncognitivist theories, this proposal does not aim to justify the behavior of moral attitudes in terms of any underlying cognitive function. The recipe semantics allows us to characterize them in terms of the distinctive functions that their constituent components play in other contexts, while admitting that they may have no particular function in many. In order to make this account more palatable, the paper concludes by offering an account of the evolution of normative attitudes that would render their occasional non-functionality unsurprising.

          br
            p Thirders have traditionally relied on conditionalizations in arguing for their favored answer to the Sleeping Beauty problem. This paper offers a critique of such applications of conditionalization. It is argued that while conditionalization may be generally appropriate, it's appropriateness is dependent on whether certain evidential features are preserved over time. 
              In the Sleeping Beauty scenario, it appears as if the relevant features are not preserved. Therefore, the major arguments for thirdism should be unconvincing.
